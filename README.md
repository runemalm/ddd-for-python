## DDD for Python  

This is a framework for developing apps based on domain-driven design.
 The design is inspired by Vaughn Vernon's reference implementation of DDD in Java.
 A little bit of inspiration also comes from django.

### Purpose:

The goal of this project is to provide a complete framework for implementing DDD bounded contexts in Python.

Full documentation will be available in version 1.0.0. There's a code example for a 'shipping' context in the 'examples' folder you can look at meanwhile.

Star and/or follow the project to receive notifications when version 1.0.0 is released.

### Design: 

The design is based on these patterns:

- DDD (collection of patterns)
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Near-infinite Scalability ("Entity" concept)
- xUnit (for testing)

### Theory:

### Supported Python Versions:

- Tested with python 3.8.5.
- Should work with any version >= 3.8.0 (not tested).
  
### Installation:
  
```bash
$ pip install ddd-for-python
```
  
### Example:

```python
# This is the "main.py" file that
# starts the bounded context in a container.

from ddd.application.config import Config
from ddd.infrastructure.container import Container

from shipping.utils.dep_mgr import DependencyManager
from shipping.application.shipping_application_service import \
    ShippingApplicationService


if __name__ == "__main__":
    """
    This is the container entry point.    
    Creates the application service and runs it in the container.
    """
    
    # Config
    config = Config()

    # Dependency manager
    dep_mgr = \
        DependencyManager(
            config=config,
        )

    # Application service
    service = \
        ShippingApplicationService(
            customer_repository=dep_mgr.get_customer_repository(),
            db_service=dep_mgr.get_db_service(),
            domain_adapter=dep_mgr.get_domain_adapter(),
            domain_publisher=dep_mgr.get_domain_publisher(),
            event_repository=dep_mgr.get_event_repository(),
            interchange_adapter=dep_mgr.get_interchange_adapter(),
            interchange_publisher=dep_mgr.get_interchange_publisher(),
            job_adapter=dep_mgr.get_job_adapter(),
            job_service=dep_mgr.get_job_service(),
            log_service=dep_mgr.get_log_service(),
            scheduler_adapter=dep_mgr.get_scheduler_adapter(),
            shipment_repository=dep_mgr.get_shipment_repository(),
            max_concurrent_actions=config.max_concurrent_actions,
            loop=config.loop.instance,
        )

    # ..register
    dep_mgr.set_service(service)

    # Container
    container = \
        Container(
            app_service=service,
            log_service=dep_mgr.get_log_service(),
        )

    # ..run
    loop = config.loop.instance
    loop.run_until_complete(container.run())
    loop.close()
```
