# Webshop Application

NOTE: This example is under development.

## Description

This is the webshop sample application.

It shows how the bounded contexts comprising this application can be implemented using ddd-for-python.

So far, it contains a single "Shipping" context. More contexts will be added with time, like "Recommendation", "Catalog", "Customer", etc.
